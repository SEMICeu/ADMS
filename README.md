# ADMS

This is the issue tracker for the maintenance of the ADMS Vocabulary.
The Asset Description Metadata Schema (ADMS) is a vocabulary to describe reusable solutions, such as data models and specifications, reference data and open source software. On 1 August 2013, W3C published ADMS as a W3C Working Group note [https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-adms/](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-adms/).

The ADMS specification was originally drafted to describe semantic interoperability solutions (previously referred to as semantic assets). This application profile of ADMS aims to extend the use of ADMS for the description of other types of interoperability solutions, meaning solutions covering the political, legal, organisational and technical interoperability layers defined by the European Interoperability Framework [https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/eif](https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/eif).

With this new release (2.00) ADMS is decoupled to the furthest extent possible from DCAT (no formal ties), while maintaining its original definitions. In essence one can consider this as a broadening of the ADMS terms. Doing so the lifecycle of ADMS is not anymore bound to the lifecycle of DCAT.
